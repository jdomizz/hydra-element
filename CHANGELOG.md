## [Unreleased]

## [0.7.0] - 2026-08-29

### Added

- `ready` promise property — resolves with `{ synth }` when Hydra is initialized, safe to await even after connection
- `loadScript()` now works in non-global mode — third-party libraries load without `global="true"`
- Canvas resolution automatically follows element CSS size via ResizeObserver
- CSS parts support — `::part(canvas)` and `::part(analyzer)` for styling internal canvases
- Re-evaluation when `canvas` property changes — scene re-renders on custom canvas
- Reconnection safety — moving element in DOM no longer re-initializes synth

### Changed

- Default canvas size is now 0×0 (falls back to 1280×720) instead of `window.innerWidth × innerHeight`
- Explicit `width`/`height` attributes take precedence over ResizeObserver

### Removed

- **BREAKING**: `analyzer` attribute — use `::part(analyzer) { display: none }` CSS instead
- **BREAKING**: `pb` option — access via `el.synth.pb` if needed

## [0.6.0] - 2026-02-14

### Added

- New `analyzer` attribute to disable the Hydra audio analyzer UI.

### Changed

## [0.5.0] - 2023-12-17

## [0.4.1] - 2023-12-17

### Fixed

- Exception thrown when using `loadScript` in local mode
- Exception thrown when using `setFunction` in local mode

## [0.4.0] - 2023-12-16

### Changed

- Attribute `global` is now `false` by default so each element uses its own private `hydra-synth` engine

## [0.3.1] - 2023-12-12

### Added

- JSDoc for documentation and typing
- Unit tests

### Fixed

- New `pb` property
- New `canvas` property

### Fixed

### Changed

- The bundler has been changed from webpack to vite

## [0.2.0] - 2021-09-04

### Changed

- Ensure the hydra-synth is created only once. As a result the component loses reactivity to attribute changes 😒

### Fixed

### Fixed

- Distribute the correct bundle 😅

## [0.1.1] - 2021-08-17
